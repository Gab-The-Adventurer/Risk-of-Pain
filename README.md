# Risk-of-Pain
Simple Risk of Rain clone to test the Raylib 4.0 library and practice my C programming skills.

**EDIT:** literally just 12 days later I checked back here and realized this code is a mess, I should've used a bit of OOP, more structs and other Quality of Life stuff. 

Anyways, I did this on my first semester of college, hopefully in the future I will look back and say: *Nanikore?? What was I thinking? Can't believe I used to code like this*

Dear future me 5 years from now: *You've improved a ton didn't you? Congrats! This is where we started!*
